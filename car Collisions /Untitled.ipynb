The main objective of this is to identify the features that Result in high and low severities.  These will be important factors to understand what contributes to the lethal and non-leathal features within the dataset. Afterwards data for the highly dangerous features that result in a lethal out come will be presented and the features that result in a non-lethal out come will be presented as well."
